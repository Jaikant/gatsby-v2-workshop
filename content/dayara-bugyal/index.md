Dayara Bugyal is perhaps one of the most beautiful alpine meadow in India. The meadow stretches out far and wide. The panoramic view of the Himalayas from here is breathtaking. Situated at an elevation of about 3048 m, this vast meadow is second to none in natural beauty. The trek goes through open stretches and dense forest at different places. In winters the meadows are covered with snow & look extremely beautiful.


The mighty Himalayas have a unique charm about them and their beauty is simply unmatched. Besides snow-clad mountains, the region is famous for its scenic meadows, which over the years have become popular trekking routes and one such is the Dayara Bugyal trek. This trail takes adventure enthusiasts to some of the scenic open lands and thick forests, ending at a vast region of lush green meadow. Many have described this trek to be like a fairy-tale and the untouched beauty of this region is a proof of that.

The Dayara Bugyal trekking expedition starts from Barsu, a small village in the district of Uttarkashi that serves as the base camp for this breathtaking experience. To reach Barsu, you will undertake a full-day drive from the revered town of Haridwar. All along this route, starting from Barsu and Barnala, you will get an opportunity to behold the serenity of the Greater Himalayas and various other lofty peaks. On this expedition, climb up to the highest point on the trek â€“ Bakaria Top (12000 ft); the ascent to it is quite steep and difficult. Spend some quality time at this place and cherish the mesmeric views of the surrounding environs. On the following day, you descend back towards the base camp in Barsu, but en route visit Pichkiya and click pictures of its scenic alpine forests and rivulets. This Dayara Bugyal trek comes to its conclusion at Barsu, following which, you drive to Haridwar and from there on to New Delhi.
