I had been waiting to trek the Hampta Pass for a long time, but like most other people, getting a break from work was the challenge. I love my work and taking time off at the expense of work was unacceptable to me, but what was even more unacceptable was breaking a friends heart. So when my friend set his heart on this trek, I just could not refuse.

It was that lucky phone call during one of my busy work days from Nikhil that got me thinking of a suitable trek for him. This would be Nikhilâ€™s first high altitude Himalayan trek. We were considering doing either the Hampta Pass trek or the Hampta Circle trek. I wrote another piece comparing these two treks, if you are in two minds like I was.

### Hampta Pass Trek From Jobri to Jwara

We started our trek from Jobri. Jobri is nearly a 2 hour drive from Manali, mostly because of the bad roads. Our guide Ravi Thakur had arranged a cab for us from Prini Village, the cabs in and around Manali cost a fortune, but then looking at those terrible roads I assume the cab drivers spend half of what they earn fixing their vehicles after the trip. Duh.
